You are working on the GymSaathi production codebase.

The application already has COMPLETE documentation and implementation for:
- Core product features
- Backend APIs
- Frontend architecture
- Database schema
- Business logic & algorithms
- Billing, attendance, diet planner, shop, classes
- Security at application level
- Role-based access control
- Multi-tenant isolation via gymId

⚠️ DO NOT re-document or re-explain existing features.

Your task is to IDENTIFY, ASK, and FILL IN EVERYTHING THAT IS STILL MISSING OR IMPLICIT,
especially in the following areas:

========================
1. SUPABASE-SPECIFIC DETAILS (VERY IMPORTANT)
========================
Explicitly analyze and document:
- Whether Supabase Auth is used or NOT used (and why)
- Whether Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled or disabled
- Exact reasoning for choosing application-layer isolation instead of RLS
- Correct usage rules for:
  - SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
  - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
- Where each key is allowed to be used (frontend vs backend)
- Supabase Storage architecture:
  - Bucket names
  - Public vs private buckets
  - Signed URL strategy
  - File naming conventions
  - Retention & cleanup strategy

If something is missing or unsafe, CALL IT OUT clearly.

========================
2. CRON JOBS & BACKGROUND TASKS
========================
Analyze and document:
- Where cron jobs currently run (Node process, Replit, etc.)
- What happens if the server restarts
- Which jobs are critical (billing, attendance auto-checkout, reminders)
- Risks of current implementation
- Recommended production-grade alternatives:
  - Supabase Edge Functions
  - External cron (GitHub Actions / Render / Railway)
  - Message queues (future)

========================
3. OBSERVABILITY & MONITORING (WHAT’S MISSING)
========================
Explicitly state:
- Current logging strategy
- What is NOT implemented:
  - Error monitoring (Sentry, etc.)
  - Performance monitoring
  - Alerts for failed payments / failed WhatsApp / cron failures
- Recommend minimal additions required for production readiness

========================
4. BACKUP & DISASTER RECOVERY
========================
Document:
- Supabase automated backups (assumptions + limits)
- What data is backed up
- What is NOT backed up (storage, env vars, sessions)
- Restore strategy
- Data loss risk analysis

========================
5. ENVIRONMENT SEPARATION
========================
Clarify:
- Dev vs Prod Supabase projects
- Dev vs Prod buckets
- Dev vs Prod WhatsApp / Email configs
- Whether feature flags exist (if not, say so)
- Risk of using single environment

========================
6. API VERSIONING & FUTURE CLIENTS
========================
Analyze:
- Current lack of API versioning
- Risks for mobile apps
- Backward compatibility concerns
- Recommended versioning strategy (without changing current APIs)

========================
7. DATA RETENTION & COMPLIANCE
========================
Explicitly define:
- Audit log retention period
- Security audit expiry logic
- GDPR-style deletion behavior
- Soft delete vs hard delete decisions
- Member data lifecycle after gym deletion

========================
8. SCALING & PERFORMANCE ASSUMPTIONS
========================
State clearly:
- Expected scale (gyms, members, traffic)
- Database bottlenecks
- Session store scaling limits
- When monolith becomes a problem
- What would be split first (auth, billing, analytics, etc.)

========================
9. OUTPUT FORMAT
========================
Produce:
- A **clear structured document**
- Headings + bullet points
- No filler explanations
- No repetition of already-documented features
- Explicit “CURRENT STATE” vs “RECOMMENDED” sections

If something is unknown, ASK the question explicitly instead of guessing.

Your goal:
👉 Make GymSaathi **enterprise-ready, audit-ready, and future-scalable** on paper.
