CURRENT ISSUES

At the moment, the Workout Planner is showing random, auto-filled data such as:

Workout Plan Name: Upper Lower – Muscle Gain

Split: Upper / Lower

Duration: Week 1 of 8

Days/Week: 4

Goal: Muscle Gain

Level: Intermediate

This data is being displayed without the user explicitly entering or confirming it, which is incorrect behavior.

Additionally:

The Start / Time button is not working properly

Workout timers do not behave reliably

The overall workout flow is broken across frontend, backend, and database

🎯 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR (STRICT)
1️⃣ NO RANDOM OR AUTO-FILLED DATA

Do NOT display:

Goal

Level

Days per week

Workout split

Plan duration
unless the member has manually provided this information

Workout plan summary must remain empty or hidden until:

User completes the required input flow

User explicitly clicks Generate Plan

2️⃣ MANDATORY USER INPUT FLOW (HARD BLOCK)

Before generating or showing any workout plan, the member must manually fill:

Fitness Goal

Experience Level

Workout Days per Week

Session Duration

Workout Preference (Home / Gym)

Injury / Medical Condition (Yes / No)

🚫 Disable Generate Plan until all required fields are completed.

3️⃣ FRONTEND FIXES (TYPECRIPT UI)

Remove all hardcoded / default workout data from UI state

Do not pre-render:

Plan name

Goal

Level

Workout split

Render workout summary only after valid API response

Start / Time Button

Fix the Start Workout / Start Exercise button:

It must respond immediately

It must trigger timers correctly

It must not depend on random state values

4️⃣ BACKEND FIXES (NODE.JS + TYPESCRIPT)

Remove any fallback logic that:

Auto-assigns workout plans

Uses default goal/level values

Workout plan generation API must:

IF mandatory user inputs are missing
  RETURN 422 (validation error)
DO NOT generate or return workout plan data


Only generate plan when:

User inputs are explicitly saved

Generate Plan is clicked

5️⃣ DATABASE FIXES (SUPABASE)

Ensure workout plans are created only after valid user input

Do not store:

Random goals

Random levels

Random workout splits

Verify:

member_profiles contains correct user-entered data

workout_plans reference actual user inputs

No orphan or auto-generated rows exist

6️⃣ TIMER & START FLOW (CRITICAL)

Fix the Start Workout / Start Exercise flow:

Timer must start when user clicks Start Exercise

Timer must stop when exercise is completed or skipped

Total workout timer must persist across exercises

User cannot start the next exercise until:

Current exercise is completed or skipped

7️⃣ END-TO-END FLOW VERIFICATION

Please verify and fix the entire flow:

User clicks Generate Plan

Input modal opens

User fills required details

User confirms

Backend validates inputs

Plan is generated

Plan summary appears correctly

Start button works

Timers function correctly

Data is saved correctly in Supabase

🚫 WHAT NOT TO DO

Do not show random workout data

Do not assume defaults

Do not auto-generate plans

Do not expose raw backend errors to UI

✅ FINAL GOAL

Workout Planner must be:

✔ User-driven
✔ Deterministic (no randomness)
✔ Fully validated
✔ Timer-accurate
✔ Frontend + backend + database consistent

The user should only see what they explicitly entered or confirmed.
