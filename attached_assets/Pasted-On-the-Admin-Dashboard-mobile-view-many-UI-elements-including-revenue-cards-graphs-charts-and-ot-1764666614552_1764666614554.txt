On the Admin Dashboard mobile view many UI elements — including revenue cards, graphs, charts and other key contents — are not visible or are clipped, overlapping, or unusable on smaller screens. The project uses TypeScript, React (frontend), Node.js (backend) and Supabase (DB/storage). I need a developer to audit and fix the entire responsive experience so the dashboard is fully functional and visually correct on mobile devices.

Objective (one-line)

Ensure the Admin Dashboard displays all content and interactive charts correctly on mobile (portrait and landscape) with no visual overflow, no hidden content, and no console or network errors.

Scope & Requirements

1. Layout & CSS

Audit and fix CSS, layout, and component structure so all dashboard sections (header, side nav, main content, cards, charts, tables, footers) render correctly on small screens.

Implement a mobile-first responsive approach using CSS (Tailwind / plain CSS / styled-components — follow project conventions).

Provide breakpoints and rules for common widths (≤360px, 375px, 412px, 768px).

Ensure side navigation collapses into a hamburger or bottom nav on mobile and does not cover important content.

Prevent content clipping, horizontal scroll, and overflow issues. Use overflow-wrap, word-break, and proper max-width/min-width rules for cards.

Ensure consistent spacing, readable font sizes, and touch-friendly hit targets (minimum 44x44px per control).

2. Charts & Graphs

Make charts responsive. If using a chart library (Recharts, Chart.js, ApexCharts, ECharts, etc.), use the library’s responsive/resize API or wrap charts in containers that resize with ResizeObserver/window resize events.

Ensure legends, axes, and labels scale or collapse for small screens (e.g., hide long labels, use tooltips).

Avoid fixed-width canvases/containers that cause clipping; use percentage widths and height rules appropriate for mobile.

Test chart interactions (tooltips, pan/zoom) on touch devices and implement touch-friendly behavior.

3. Cards & Tables

Convert wide tables into responsive patterns: vertical stacking, overflow scroll with sticky first column, or a detail-expand modal.

Ensure cards reflow vertically on mobile and do not overlap.

Make summary widgets (revenue, active members, churn) visible at the top in a compact stacked layout.

4. Images & Media

Ensure any images (e.g., logos, QR codes) use max-width:100% and properly scaled srcset where needed.

Lazy-load heavy charts/images if they affect initial render on mobile.

5. Performance & Errors

Remove console errors and warnings related to layout or DOM measurements.

Ensure no broken Supabase calls or failed network requests on mobile-specific code paths.

Optimize re-renders and layout thrashing on resize.

6. Accessibility & UX

Maintain accessible contrast and readable fonts in mobile view.

Ensure interactive elements are keyboard/touch accessible and include appropriate ARIA attributes where needed.

Provide clear fallback messages if data fails to load (e.g., “Unable to load revenue chart — retry”).

7. Testing & Verification

Test and verify on:

Chrome/Firefox mobile emulation (DevTools)

Physical devices (Android, iOS) OR BrowserStack / similar (if available)

Common viewport sizes (360x640, 375x812, 393x852, 412x915, 768x1024)

Provide screenshots (before / after) of key pages on at least three mobile viewport sizes.

Include unit/integration test changes if UI testing exists (Jest + React Testing Library / Cypress E2E).

Deliverables

Updated frontend code (React + TypeScript) with responsive CSS and component adjustments.

Minor backend or API fixes if any mobile-specific data issues are found (Node.js).

Supabase config checks if relevant (no broken queries or missing pagination causing UI break).

Acceptance checklist and verification steps for QA.

Acceptance Criteria

On mobile portrait (≤412px width) all dashboard key elements (header, navigation, revenue widgets, main revenue chart, latest payments table) are visible and usable without horizontal scrolling.

Charts resize and show readable axes/labels or reasonable fallbacks/tooltips.

No console errors or uncaught exceptions on mobile.

Supabase data loads correctly and consistently on mobile.

Navigation is usable (hamburger or bottom nav) and does not block content.

Developer provides screenshots and notes proving the fixes.

Notes for Implementer

Follow existing styling conventions (Tailwind/CSS modules) already used in the repo.

If adding new dependencies (small, well-known libs only), justify them in the report.

Keep changes minimal and confined to relevant components; avoid unnecessary refactors.

If a chart library lacks mobile support, propose an alternative or implement a graceful fallback.
