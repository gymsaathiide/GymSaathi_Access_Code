Design a responsive “Diet Planner” configuration screen for a member dashboard.

Use React + Tailwind CSS. The UI should look like a clean card inside a dashboard, suitable for both desktop and mobile.

Include the following sections and behaviors exactly:

Header

Title at the top left: Diet Plan.

Optional subtitle under it in smaller text: Configure your personalised meal plan.

Meal type selector (top row)

Three toggle buttons in a row functioning as tabs:

Breakfast

Lunch

Dinner

Only one can be active at a time.

The active tab should be visually highlighted (filled background, bold text).

Assume that based on the active tab, the planner will later show plan details for that meal (you can just keep a placeholder text like “Breakfast plan settings selected” etc. for now).

TDEE information card

A full-width card below the meal selector.

Large text: Your TDEE.

Below that, dynamic text placeholder: 2384 kcal (this will come from backend later).

Small helper text: Calculated from your body composition.

Style it as a prominent info card.

Goal selection

Section title: Select your goal.

Three selectable cards in one row (stack vertically on mobile):

Fat Loss

Subtitle line: TDEE - 200 kcal.

Muscle Gain

Subtitle line: TDEE + 200 kcal.

Trim and Tone

Subtitle line: TDEE (Maintenance).

Cards behave like radio buttons: only one goal can be active.

When a card is selected, store targetCalories in state:

Fat Loss → tdee - 200

Muscle Gain → tdee + 200

Trim and Tone → tdee

Show the selected card with a clear active state (border highlight, background, check icon, etc.).

Plan duration

Section title: Plan duration.

Two pill-style buttons:

7 days

30 days

Only one can be active at a time.

Save the selected duration (7 or 30) into state and visually highlight the active one.

Dietary preference (directory preference in sketch)

Section title: Dietary preference.

Three toggle buttons in a row:

Veg

Egg

Non-Veg

Behavior / filtering logic (document this in comments and mock the behavior with placeholder text):

When Veg is active → show only veg meals.

When Egg is active → show veg + egg-based meals.

When Non-Veg is active → show veg + egg + non-veg meals.

Visually indicate which preference is selected.

Festival mode

Section title: Festival mode.

Four pill buttons aligned in a row (wrap on mobile):

None

Navratri

Ekadashi

Fasting

Only one option can be active.

None is default.

When any festival mode except None is selected, show a small helper text like:

We will only use festival-friendly meals for your plan.

In code, store the selected festival mode in state. Add placeholder comment where actual filter logic will go.

Plan summary (optional but helpful)

Under the selectors, display a small summary line:

Example: Target: 2184 kcal/day · Duration: 7 days · Preference: Egg · Mode: None

Values should reflect the chosen goal, duration, dietary preference, and festival mode.

Generate Plan button

At the bottom, centered and full width on mobile:

Primary button text: Generate Plan.

On click, for now just log all selected values (meal tab, goal, targetCalories, duration, dietary preference, festival mode) to the console and show a toast or message: Diet plan generated with your current settings.

General requirements

Entire layout should be responsive: stacked cards on mobile, horizontal rows on desktop.

Use Tailwind classes for spacing, alignment, and typography.

Use a neutral, modern color palette suitable for a health/fitness dashboard.

Organize the component cleanly (state hooks at top, small helper components for reusable buttons/cards).

Add clear code comments explaining:

Where TDEE will come from backend/BMI.

Where filters for Veg/Egg/Non-Veg and Festival Mode will be applied.

How target calories are derived based on selected goal.

Build everything as a single React component called DietPlanner that I can drop into my existing dashboard.
