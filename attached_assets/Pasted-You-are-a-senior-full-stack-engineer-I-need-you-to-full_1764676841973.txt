You are a senior full-stack engineer.
I need you to fully implement and fix the following notification features in my app (Supabase + modern frontend stack):

1️⃣ Member Notifications After Order Placement

When a member places an order, they should automatically receive:

A. WhatsApp Notification

Send a WhatsApp message using the existing integration or the one you configure.
Message must include:

Member Name

Order ID

Product(s) ordered

Total Amount

A short thank-you line

Example message:

Hello <name>! 🎉  
Your order (<Order ID>) has been successfully placed.  
Total Amount: ₹<amount>  
Thank you for shopping with us!

B. Email Notification

Send an email confirmation with:

Subject: “Your Order Confirmation - <Order ID>”

Body containing:

Greeting

Order details

Payment summary

Support contact

C. In-App Notification (Toast)

Immediately after order placement:

Show a modern, clean success toast

Slide in from the top-right or bottom

Auto-hide after 2 seconds

Non-blocking UI

Use smooth fade-out or slide-out animation

2️⃣ Improve the “Add to Cart” Notification (2 Seconds Only)

When the user adds a product to the cart:

UI Requirements

Notification must appear from the right side

Must be minimal, modern, clean

Rounded corners, subtle shadow

No sliding panels, no overlapping UI

Auto-hide after 2 seconds

Should NOT block any buttons or screen content

Should be responsive on mobile and look elegant

Content Example
✔ Added to cart
<product name>

Tech Requirements

Use a NotificationProvider or toast manager

Add entry + exit animations

Use either CSS transitions, framer-motion, or Tailwind animations

Ensure no manual dismissal is required

3️⃣ Backend Logic Requirements

Inside the order placement backend API:

Create the order in the DB

After success:

Send WhatsApp notification

Send Email confirmation

Insert an entry in the notifications table for member

Return a clean JSON success response

Handle errors so they NEVER crash the order flow

You must provide:

The full backend logic

WhatsApp payload format

Email sending function (Node/Nodemailer or service used)

The notification DB insert code

Error handling to avoid breaking the main order

4️⃣ Frontend Requirements
After clicking “Place Order”:

Show a loading state

When API succeeds:

Show 2-second success toast

Clear cart (localStorage + UI state + Supabase if applicable)

Redirect to success page or show success state

When adding to cart:

Trigger the 2-second toast

Persist cart to localStorage (immediately)

Update UI state

5️⃣ Deliverables You Must Provide

You must provide:

A. Full React code

Notification/Toast provider

Example usage in “Add to Cart”

Example usage in “Order Placed”

B. Full Backend Code

API route for order placement

WhatsApp sending logic

Email sending logic

Notification DB insert code

Error handling

C. Any Supabase Schema Adjustments (if needed)
D. Final Explanation

A simple explanation of:

How the toast works

How WhatsApp + email integrate

Why this solution avoids UI blocking

How data stays synced with localStorage

6️⃣ First Step for You

Your first response must ask me to upload:

Order placement API file

Cart context/state file

Notification component file

WhatsApp integration file (if exists)

Email service file

Admin and member order pages

Then provide step-by-step corrected code.

If you follow this spec, the app will have:

✔ Smooth 2-second notifications
✔ Professional UI
✔ Real WhatsApp + email confirmations
✔ A non-blocking experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop
