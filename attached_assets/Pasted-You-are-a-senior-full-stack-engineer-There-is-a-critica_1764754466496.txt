You are a senior full-stack engineer.
There is a critical bug in my app:

When I click on User Management, I am seeing two dashboards loading together, which should never happen.

I have already asked multiple times, but the bug is still not fixed.
This time, I want you to fully diagnose and resolve it end-to-end — frontend, backend, and database — with zero errors.

1️⃣ FRONTEND – FIX DOUBLE RENDER & LAYOUT
Problem:

In the User Management section, two dashboards or layouts are being rendered at the same time.

It looks like duplicate components, nested dashboards, or routing/layout issues.

Your Tasks:

Audit the routing & layout for User Management

Check all routes related to:

/user-management

/super-admin/user-management

Any nested UserManagement route.

Find where the Dashboard layout is being included more than once:

Example: <DashboardLayout> wrapping <UserManagement> while <UserManagement> itself also includes a layout, or being rendered twice in a parent.

Ensure only one dashboard is rendered

There must be one and only one “dashboard shell/layout” around the User Management content.

Remove:

Duplicate imports of the same dashboard component.

Any conditional rendering that ends up mounting two instances.

Any nested routing that renders both a parent dashboard and an extra dashboard inside the child.

Check component tree

Inspect:

SuperAdminDashboard / AdminDashboard components

UserManagement page/component

Layout components (e.g., MainLayout, DashboardLayout, AppLayout, etc.)

Ensure:

UserManagement is rendered inside the layout only once.

No fragment, conditional, or <Outlet> logic is causing a second dashboard to render.

Fix UI & Layout issues

Clean up any duplicated headers, sidebars, or containers in the User Management section.

Make sure:

The layout is consistent with the rest of the app.

The design is clean on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Remove any accidental nested cards/containers that make it look like two dashboards.

TypeScript

Frontend is in TypeScript.
Ensure all changes compile with no TS errors.

2️⃣ BACKEND – ROUTING & RESPONSE HANDLING
Your Tasks:

Verify backend routes for User Management

Check the API endpoints used by the User Management section:

e.g., /api/users, /api/user-management, /api/admin/users, etc.

Make sure:

There is a single, correct endpoint for loading the User Management data.

No duplicate endpoints that are both being called from the frontend.

Remove duplicate logic

If there are two different APIs returning the same user list or dashboard data:

Consolidate into a single, clean route.

Ensure the frontend calls only that one route.

Correct data & components

Confirm the backend is returning only the data, not any “wrapper” or meta-structure that would cause the frontend to render twice.

Make sure the backend does not send anything that triggers multiple mounts or two dashboards loaded conditionally.

Error handling

Ensure the User Management API:

Validates requests properly.

Returns clear, simple error messages if something fails.

No unhandled exceptions or 500 errors.

3️⃣ DATABASE & ROLE-BASED ACCESS
Your Tasks:

Check role-based access

Confirm that User Management is correctly tied to:

super_admin (or the intended role).

Make sure:

Only allowed roles can access User Management.

No duplicated logic where:

One role sees one dashboard, and another dashboard also gets mounted conditionally.

Correct data source

Make sure the User Management section:

Uses the correct table(s) (e.g., users, roles, members, etc.).

Does not mix two different data sets that result in two dashboards appearing.

4️⃣ ZERO ERRORS REQUIREMENT

I want absolutely no errors in this module.

That means:

Frontend

No React errors or warnings in console.

No TypeScript errors.

No duplicate rendering of layouts, dashboards, or User Management content.

Clean, single, consistent dashboard view.

Backend

No 4xx/5xx errors during normal use of User Management.

Correct routing and responses.

No duplicated logic or legacy endpoints being called.

Database

No permission errors.

No missing data or mismatched mapping.

Testing

You must mentally walk through:

Navigating to User Management from Super Admin.

Refreshing the page on User Management.

Navigating back and forth between different sections and then returning to User Management.

In all cases:

Only one dashboard view should be visible.

No flickering, no double load, no duplicate headers/sidebars.

5️⃣ WHAT YOU MUST DELIVER

You must provide:

Frontend Fix

Updated UserManagement page/component (full code).

Updated layout/routing logic showing exactly how dashboards and layouts are composed.

Explanation of what caused the double rendering and how you resolved it.

Backend Fix

Cleaned-up User Management API route(s).

Removed/merged any duplicate endpoints.

Explanation of the final endpoint structure.

Database/Access Fix

Verification of role-based access for User Management.

Any necessary changes to queries or role checks.

Final Confirmation

A short checklist that confirms:

 Only one dashboard loads for User Management

 No duplicate rendering

 No frontend/TypeScript errors

 No backend/API errors for this module

 Correct role-based access

If you need context, ask me specifically for:

The User Management component file

The Super Admin Dashboard/Layout files

The routing configuration (frontend)

The User Management API route file

Final Goal:
A clean, single, error-free User Management dashboard view, with correct routing, layout, and role-based access — no duplicate dashboards under any circumstance.
