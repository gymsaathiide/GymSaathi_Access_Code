NEW FEATURE TO BUILD
Add **Email Integration (Resend)** and **WhatsApp Integration (WatX)** so that:

1. When **Superadmin creates a Gym Admin**
   - Send a **welcome email** to the new Gym Admin with:
     - Gym name
     - Admin name
     - Admin email
     - Temporary password
     - Login URL
     - Role = “Gym Admin”
   - Send a **WhatsApp message** to the Gym Admin’s phone number with:
     - Short welcome message
     - Gym name
     - Login URL
     - Email + temporary password in a safe, readable format

2. When **Gym Admin creates a Member**
   - Send a **welcome email** to the new member with:
     - Member name
     - Gym name
     - Member email
     - Temporary password or login token (if applicable)
     - Member portal URL
     - Role = “Member”
   - Send a **WhatsApp message** to the member’s phone with:
     - Welcome to [Gym Name]
     - Brief info on portal access (classes, attendance, store, etc.)
     - Member portal URL
     - Email + temporary password (or access details)

INTEGRATIONS TO USE

A) EMAIL – RESEND
- Use Resend for transactional emails.
- Expect these env vars:
  - RESEND_API_KEY
  - RESEND_FROM_EMAIL (e.g. "no-reply@gymsaathi.com")
- Create a small email service module, e.g. `emailService.ts` with something like:
  - `sendGymAdminWelcomeEmail(payload)`
  - `sendMemberWelcomeEmail(payload)`
- Each function should take a clear typed payload, e.g.:
  - For Gym Admin:
    - gymName
    - adminName
    - adminEmail
    - tempPassword
    - loginUrl
  - For Member:
    - gymName
    - memberName
    - memberEmail
    - tempPassword (if used)
    - memberPortalUrl
- Use a clean HTML + text template (simple, mobile friendly, no external CSS dependencies).
- Make the Resend integration robust:
  - Handle errors with try/catch
  - Log failures to server console (or a simple log function) but DO NOT crash the main request if email sending fails.

B) WHATSAPP – WatX (or similar provider)
- Assume a WhatsApp API provider named WatX with an HTTP endpoint.
- Expect env vars:
  - WATX_API_KEY
  - WATX_SENDER_ID or WATX_NUMBER (whatever is needed)
  - WATX_BASE_URL
- Make a `whatsappService.ts` with functions:
  - `sendGymAdminWelcomeWhatsApp(payload)`
  - `sendMemberWelcomeWhatsApp(payload)`
- Payload fields:
  - phoneNumber (string, in full international format, e.g. +91XXXXXXXXXX)
  - gymName
  - personName
  - loginUrl or portalUrl
  - email
  - tempPassword
- Message style:
  - Short, clean, no spammy formatting.
  - Example for Gym Admin (pseudo):
    - “Hi [Name], welcome to GYMSAATHI. You have been added as Gym Admin for [Gym Name]. Login: [URL]. Email: [email], Temp password: [tempPassword]. Please change your password after first login.”
  - Example for Member:
    - “Hi [Name], welcome to [Gym Name]. Your GYMSAATHI member portal is ready: [URL]. Email: [email], Temp password: [tempPassword]. See your classes, attendance and store in one place.”

TRIGGERS / WHERE TO CALL

1) When Superadmin creates a Gym Admin:
   - There is already an endpoint like `POST /api/superadmin/gyms/:gymId/admins` (or similar).
   - After the Gym Admin user is successfully created in the database:
     - Generate a temporary password (if not already generated by current code).
     - Save the hashed password as usual.
     - Then:
       - Call `sendGymAdminWelcomeEmail(...)`
       - Call `sendGymAdminWelcomeWhatsApp(...)`
   - Ensure these calls run AFTER successful DB writes.
   - If email/WhatsApp fail, return success for user creation but log the error.

2) When Gym Admin creates a Member:
   - There is already an endpoint like `POST /api/admin/members`.
   - Same pattern:
     - After member is created and password set, call:
       - `sendMemberWelcomeEmail(...)`
       - `sendMemberWelcomeWhatsApp(...)`
   - Again, do not block user creation if messaging fails.

CONFIG / TOGGLES

- Add simple config toggles (for now as env or a small config object):
  - `ENABLE_EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS=true/false`
  - `ENABLE_WHATSAPP_NOTIFICATIONS=true/false`
- If disabled, the corresponding message service functions should no-op.

RELIABILITY & STRUCTURE

- Keep messaging logic OUTSIDE route handlers:
  - Controllers should call service-level functions.
  - Email + WhatsApp modules should be reusable.
- Use TypeScript types for all payloads.
- Handle:
  - Missing phone number → skip WhatsApp gracefully.
  - Missing email → skip email gracefully.
- Add small console logs like:
  - `[email] Sent gym admin welcome email to ...`
  - `[whatsapp] Sent member welcome message to ...`
  - And `[email] ERROR ...` on failure.

UX EXPECTATION (NO FRONTEND CHANGES NEEDED NOW, ONLY BACKEND)
- Frontend doesn’t need to show anything special initially.
- Just keep the behavior server-side:
  - When a superadmin/admin creates a user, the user receives email + WhatsApp.
- Later, we can add UI badges like "Welcome email sent" but NOT in this task.

DELIVERABLE EXPECTED
- A Resend email integration module.
- A WatX WhatsApp integration module.
- Updated backend routes for:
  - Creating gym admin (trigger welcome email/WhatsApp).
  - Creating member (trigger welcome email/WhatsApp).
- Clear TypeScript types and error handling.
- No hardcoded secrets; everything via process.env.
