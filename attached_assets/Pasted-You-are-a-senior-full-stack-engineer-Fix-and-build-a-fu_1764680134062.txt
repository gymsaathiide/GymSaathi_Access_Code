You are a senior full-stack engineer.
Fix and build a fully working Shop Orders Revenue Dashboard that includes:

📌 1. Build a Fully Responsive Revenue Graph (Desktop → Mobile)

Create a modern, clean, responsive graph showing Shop Orders Revenue using Chart.js (or a similar library if the project uses it).

The graph must:

Display revenue over time (daily or monthly)

Have a clean UI

Work perfectly on:

Desktop

Laptop

Tablet

Mobile (very important)

Auto-resize with the screen width

Avoid horizontal overflow

Maintain aspect ratio on any device

Look visually modern with smooth animations

Graph Rules

X-axis = dates

Y-axis = revenue

Tooltip shows date + revenue

Smooth line or bar style

No broken UI on small screens

Wrapper Requirements

The graph container must have styles like:

width: 100%;
height: 300px; /* mobile 260–360px range */


And graph options:

responsive: true,
maintainAspectRatio: false,

📌 2. Connect Graph to Actual Revenue Data (Backend + Supabase)

Create or fix the backend API:

GET /admin/revenue

This API must return JSON:

{
  "totalRevenue": 0,
  "ordersCount": 0,
  "graphData": [
    { "date": "2025-02-01", "revenue": 3200 },
    { "date": "2025-02-02", "revenue": 5400 }
  ]
}

Requirements

Fetch all shop orders from Supabase

Sum totalAmount

Group by date (daily or monthly)

Return sorted graph data

Prevent null/NaN values

📌 3. Real-Time Update When New Order Is Placed

Implement real-time revenue updates.

Use Supabase Realtime:

supabase
  .channel("orders")
  .on("postgres_changes", { event: "INSERT", table: "orders" }, () => {
     refreshRevenueGraph();
  })
  .subscribe();


If real-time is not available, implement refresh on page reload.

📌 4. Add Responsive UI Cards Above the Graph

Create info cards:

Today’s Revenue

Monthly Revenue

Total Orders

Average Order Value

These must be:

Responsive

Mobile-friendly

Grid layout

Smooth spacing

Good font sizes

📌 5. Full Admin Dashboard Layout (Front + Back)

Create a clean admin dashboard page:

Layout order:

Top Stats Cards

Date Filter Tabs (Today / 7 Days / 30 Days / This Month / Year)

Revenue Graph

Recent Orders Table

Everything must resize properly for all devices.

📌 6. Error Handling & Stability

No console errors

No Supabase errors

Graph should handle empty data

API must never send NaN or empty strings

Use safe defaults for missing values

Mobile UI must never overflow or break layout

📌 7. Deliverables Replit Must Produce

Replit should create:

Frontend

RevenueGraph.jsx (or .tsx)

AdminDashboard.jsx (or page file)

StatsCard.jsx

Responsive CSS/Tailwind

Real-time subscription logic

Backend

/admin/revenue API route

Supabase query for revenue + grouping

Clean error handling

Optional (If Existing System Supports It)

Realtime order event channel

New updated Supabase schema for storing orders (if missing)

📌 8. Final Output Requirements

Replit should:

✔ Build all components
✔ Fix all errors
✔ Ensure the graph renders correctly
✔ Make the whole dashboard responsive
✔ Connect API → frontend graph
✔ Ensure real-time updates
✔ Match modern UI aesthetic
✔ Work on all devices smoothly

📌 Ask me for files if needed

If any file is missing, Replit must ask:

“Please provide your Admin Dashboard component file, revenue API file, or Supabase schema file.”

🎯 END GOAL

A fully functional, beautiful, responsive, error-free Shop Orders Revenue Dashboard that works perfectly on every device and updates automatically when new orders come in.
