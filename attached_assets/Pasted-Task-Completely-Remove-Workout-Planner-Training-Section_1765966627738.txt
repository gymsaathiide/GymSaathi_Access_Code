Task: Completely Remove Workout Planner & Training Sections

(Supabase Backend + Frontend Cleanup)

Objective

Permanently and fully delete all Workout Planner and Training–related functionality from the application. This must include Supabase backend (database, storage, policies, APIs) and frontend (UI, routes, components, logic).

This is a hard deletion, not a hide/disable operation.

Applies across all roles: Super Admin, Admin, Trainer, Member.

Scope of Removal (Mandatory)
1. Supabase Backend Cleanup (Critical)
1.1 Database (Supabase Postgres)

Permanently delete only Workout Planner and Training–related data structures, including but not limited to:

Tables / Views / Functions such as:

workouts

workout_plans

exercises

training

training_plans

training_sessions

training_assignments

workout_logs

training_logs

Remove:

Foreign keys

Indexes

Triggers

Policies referencing these tables

Clean up any join tables connected to:

members

trainers

plans

Update or regenerate migrations so the schema remains valid.

1.2 Supabase Row Level Security (RLS)

Remove all RLS policies related to workout and training tables.

Ensure no RLS policy references deleted tables.

Validate remaining policies continue to work correctly.

1.3 Supabase Storage

Delete workout/training-related:

Videos

Images

PDFs

Attachments

Remove related storage buckets or folders if they are used only for these sections.

Ensure no frontend or backend logic references deleted storage paths.

1.4 Supabase Functions / Edge Functions

Remove any Supabase functions related to:

Workout creation

Training assignment

Progress tracking

Exercise management

Validate no scheduled jobs or hooks reference deleted logic.

2. Frontend Cleanup (Mandatory)
2.1 UI & Components

Delete all frontend elements related to Workout Planner and Training, including:

Pages / Routes

Components

Modals / Forms

Charts / Trackers

Progress views

Admin or Trainer management screens

2.2 Navigation

Remove Workout Planner and Training items from:

Sidebar (desktop)

Bottom navigation (tablet/mobile)

Ensure navigation remains consistent and error-free.

2.3 State & Logic

Remove:

API calls

React Query hooks

State stores

Context usage

Constants and enums

Ensure no component tries to fetch or mutate workout/training data.

3. Role-Based Verification

Confirm no role can access or trigger workout/training logic:

Super Admin

Admin

Trainer

Member

No UI entry point or backend API should exist.

4. System Stability (Non-Negotiable)

Application must:

Build successfully

Run without console errors

Run without Supabase query errors

No broken routes

No orphaned imports

No dead code references

5. Testing & Validation

Verify database schema in Supabase has zero workout/training tables.

Verify storage has no workout/training assets.

Verify frontend has no workout/training routes or components.

Test remaining features:

Diet planner

Shop

Analytics

Member management

Validate across all roles and screen sizes.

6. Final Confirmation Required

Provide confirmation that:

All Workout Planner and Training data is removed from Supabase

All related frontend code is deleted

No residual references exist

Application is stable and production-ready

Important Notes

Delete only Workout Planner and Training–related data.

Do NOT affect other modules.

Do NOT comment out code—delete it.

Maintain clean architecture and database integrity.
