Make every page and component in the project fully responsive and polished across mobile, tablet, laptop and desktop. Right now many pages (example: dashboard cards, mobile bottom nav, Diet Planner, header/sidebar) show alignment, spacing and overflow issues on mobile. Fix the UI in code and provide a high-fidelity Figma design that matches the new UI.

Scope (must include)

Global responsive system and tokens

Define breakpoints: mobile (≤640px), tablet (641–1024px), laptop (1025–1366px), desktop (>1366px).

Standardize spacing, typography scale, container widths, and touch targets.

Provide a small design tokens file (colors, spacing, radii, font sizes) to ensure visual consistency.

Pages & components to fix (all must be audited and fixed)

Dashboard (all cards, stats, My Diet Plan card).

Diet Planner (goal cards, duration selector, diet toggles, plan preview, Generate CTA).

Header + ModernSidebar (collapsed/expanded, mobile slide-in).

MobileBottomNav (avoid overlap, sticky behaviour, safe area).

Forms, modals, lists, tables, and toast messages.

Any other commonly used layout component (containers, grids, cards).

Behavior & UX requirements

Mobile-first design approach; components scale up for larger screens.

Sidebar collapses to icons on small screens; mobile menu must slide over content with a dismissible overlay.

Primary CTA (Generate / Create My Plan) should never be hidden by bottom nav; make it sticky or floating with safe spacing from nav.

All cards must maintain consistent padding, border-radius and shadow; text should not overflow containers; long text truncates with ellipsis where appropriate.

Ensure min touch target 40–48px for interactive controls.

Maintain current functionality and API calls — do not change logic or data flow.

Accessibility & performance

Ensure WCAG AA contrast for text and controls.

All interactive elements must be keyboard-accessible with proper ARIA attributes.

Optimize images and remove layout-shifting (CLS) issues.

Ensure the mobile render is performant (no huge reflows).

Deliverables

Updated frontend code (React + TypeScript) implementing responsive styles (Tailwind/CSS Modules). Provide a runnable Replit project with branches/commits.

A component/style guide (tokens + usage examples).

A high-fidelity Figma file (desktop + tablet + mobile layouts for each page above) illustrating final visuals and responsive behavior.

Screenshots (or recordings) showing pages at these widths: 360px, 412px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px, 1440px.

A short QA checklist and automated responsive test cases (e.g., Cypress or Puppeteer scripts that validate alignment and visibility at key breakpoints).

Migration notes: list of changed files and any new utility classes/tokens.

Acceptance criteria (must pass these)

Dashboard cards align in a single column on narrow screens and in a responsive grid on larger screens; no overlapping or overflow.

Mobile bottom nav never covers important CTAs; create My Plan/Generate CTA visible and accessible at all times.

Diet Planner layout matches design tokens, and toggles, selectors, and Generate CTA are usable on mobile without horizontal scrolling.

Sidebar hides or collapses gracefully; header elements reflow without overlap.

All pages pass keyboard navigation and basic a11y checks.

All layouts render correctly at the specified widths and screenshots match the provided Figma mockups within reasonable tolerance.

Prioritization & timeline (suggested)

Phase 1 (48–72 hrs): Critical fixes — dashboard, mobile bottom nav, Diet Planner main screen, floating CTA behavior; produce Figma mobile + desktop comps.

Phase 2 (next 48 hrs): Global tokens, Sidebar/Header responsiveness, forms/modals, QA tests and screenshots.

Phase 3: Finish remaining pages, polish, provide final deliverables and README.

Example issues to resolve (for reference)

Cards stacking too tightly and content clipped on 360–412px widths.

Bottom nav overlapping CTAs and content at the bottom of the screen.

Sidebar content hidden behind header or not collapsing properly on mobile.

Long text overflowing card containers and causing horizontal scroll.

Implementation notes (for the developer who will work this)

Use mobile-first Tailwind responsive utilities (or equivalent) and a max-width container for content (e.g., max-w-[1400px] mx-auto).

Prefer CSS Grid for dashboards and card layouts; use flexbox for horizontal controls and navs.

Use position: sticky carefully for headers and floating CTA; ensure z-index layers prevent overlap but also not block clicks.

For bottom safe area on iOS, respect env(safe-area-inset-bottom) padding.

Keep changes isolated to styling/layout files — no functional change allowed.
