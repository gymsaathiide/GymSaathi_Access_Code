You are acting as a Full Stack Software Engineer responsible for the frontend architecture, backend logic, and database integrity of this application. You must follow proper SaaS dashboard design principles and engineering best practices.

Do NOT create new headers, footers, layouts, or standalone pages for internal modules.
This is an internal dashboard application, not a public-facing website.

Current Problem

When clicking on Training, you are creating a new header, footer, and layout.

This breaks UI consistency and violates standard dashboard architecture.

Similar mistakes exist across Super Admin, Admin, Member, Trainer, and other roles.

Mandatory Instructions
1. Use the Existing Global Layout

One shared Header

One shared Sidebar

One shared Footer

These must persist across all internal modules and all roles.

2. Training Is a Module, Not a New Page

Render the Training feature inside the existing dashboard layout.

Only the main content section should change on navigation.

Header, sidebar, and footer must remain unchanged.

3. Extend the Application — Do Not Redesign It

Integrate new functionality into the existing UI system.

Follow the current design language: spacing, colors, typography, components.

Do not refactor or redesign unless explicitly instructed.

4. Full-Stack Consistency Is Required

As a Full Stack Software Engineer, you must ensure:

Frontend routes align exactly with backend APIs.

Backend responses match frontend data contracts.

Database schema remains normalized and consistent.

No duplicate tables, no redundant APIs, no conflicting logic.

5. Role-Based Access Must Be Preserved

Super Admin, Admin, Member, Trainer must:

Share the same base layout.

Differ only by permissions, visible modules, and allowed actions.

Do not create separate layouts per role.

6. Zero-Tolerance for Errors

No layout duplication

No UI breakage

No API mismatches

No database inconsistencies

Expected Outcome

Clicking Training updates only the main content area.

The dashboard layout remains intact.

The application behaves like a production-ready SaaS platform, not a collection of disconnected pages.

These requirements are strict and non-negotiable.
