Global Sidebar & Footer Navigation Rule

(Applies to ALL Roles and ALL Sections)

This navigation behavior must be implemented uniformly across the entire application, without exception.

Roles Covered (Mandatory)

Super Admin

Admin

No role should have different navigation behavior unless explicitly specified later.

Device-Based Navigation Behavior
1. Desktop View (≥ 1024px)

Sidebar must be visible.

Sidebar appears on the left side.

All navigation items remain in the sidebar.

Footer navigation must NOT be visible.

Main content adjusts correctly next to the sidebar.

This applies to:

Super Admin dashboard

Admin dashboard

Trainer dashboard

Member dashboard

All internal pages (analytics, classes, diet planner, shop, etc.)

2. Tablet View (≥ 768px and < 1024px)

Sidebar must be completely hidden.

Sidebar must not render at all (no collapse, no toggle).

All sidebar navigation items must appear only in the footer menu.

Footer menu:

Highlights active section

Content uses full-width layout.

3. Mobile View (< 768px)

Sidebar must remain hidden.

Sidebar content must be available only via footer menu.

Footer menu must:

Be fixed at the bottom

Be touch-optimized

No horizontal scroll

No content overlap with footer

Single Navigation Source (Critical Requirement)

Sidebar and footer must use one shared navigation configuration.

No duplicate menus for:

Super Admin

Admin

Trainer

Member

Role-based permissions should filter items from the same config, not separate menus.

Example:

navItems → filter by role → render as:
- Sidebar (desktop)
- Footer menu (tablet/mobile)

Technical & UX Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

Sidebar must never appear on tablet or mobile.

Footer menu must never appear on desktop.

No layout shifting or flickering on resize.

Navigation must stay consistent across:

Login → Dashboard → Internal pages

Behavior must be tested on:

All roles

All screen sizes

Acceptance Criteria

Same navigation experience for all roles based solely on screen size.

Zero UI duplication.

Zero alignment issues.

Zero navigation mismatch between sidebar and footer.
