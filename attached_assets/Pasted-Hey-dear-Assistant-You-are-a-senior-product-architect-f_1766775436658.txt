Hey dear Assistant,

You are a senior product architect + full-stack engineer.

Context:
We are building GymSaathi, a multi-tenant Gym ERP SaaS.
You already understand our system style (members, gyms, superadmin, reports, dashboards).
Now I want a COMPLETE, DETAILED, PRODUCTION-READY explanation of our MEAL PLANNER system.

This task is NOT to write random ideas.
You must explain HOW the Meal Planner WORKS in GymSaathi:
- Frontend
- Backend
- Database
- Roles
- Permissions
- Flows
- Dashboards
- Reports

Do NOT assume features that are not described logically.
Explain everything cleanly and systematically as if writing internal technical documentation.

--------------------------------------------------
1. PURPOSE & ROLE OF MEAL PLANNER
--------------------------------------------------

Explain:
- Why Meal Planner exists in GymSaathi
- How it complements Workout Planner
- What problem it solves for:
  - Members
  - Gym Admins
  - Superadmin

Clarify that Meal Planner is:
- A nutrition guidance system
- Not a medical prescription
- Controlled centrally via Superadmin

--------------------------------------------------
2. USER ROLES & ACCESS
--------------------------------------------------

Explain clearly what each role can do.

A) Superadmin
- Owns and manages the entire meal library
- Controls nutrition rules, meals, calories, macros
- Decides what data is visible to members

B) Gym Admin (if applicable)
- Whether gym admin can customize meals or not
- Or gym admin only assigns meal plans (if applicable)

C) Member
- Can view meal plans
- Can track meals
- Can see nutrition reports
- Cannot edit core meal data

--------------------------------------------------
3. MEAL PLANNER – HIGH LEVEL FLOW
--------------------------------------------------

Explain end-to-end flow:

1) Member opens Meal Planner
2) Meal preferences / profile is collected
3) Meal plan is generated or assigned
4) Member follows meals day-to-day
5) Reports & progress are generated

Explain this in simple logical steps.

--------------------------------------------------
4. MEMBER ONBOARDING FOR MEAL PLANNER
--------------------------------------------------

Explain what data is collected from the member for meal planning, such as:
- Goal (fat loss, muscle gain, maintenance)
- Dietary preference (veg, non-veg, egg, etc.)
- Allergies / restrictions (if supported)
- Meals per day
- Any other relevant nutrition inputs

Explain:
- Where this data is stored
- How it is reused later

--------------------------------------------------
5. FRONTEND – MEMBER MEAL PLANNER UI
--------------------------------------------------

Explain the MEMBER UI in detail:

- Calories summary
- Macros summary (if supported)
- Status (followed / skipped)

B) Daily Meal View
- Breakfast
- Lunch
- Snacks
- Dinner
For each meal:
- Meal name
- Food items
- Quantity
- Calories
- Protein / carbs / fats (if supported)

C) Meal Tracking
- Mark meal as eaten
- Skip meal
- Replace meal (if allowed)

D) Reports View
- Daily nutrition report
- Weekly summary
- Monthly summary
- Consistency tracking

--------------------------------------------------
6. FRONTEND – SUPERADMIN MEAL MANAGEMENT UI
--------------------------------------------------

Explain Superadmin UI in detail:

A) Meal Library Management
- Create meals
- Edit meals
- Delete / deactivate meals
- Add food items inside a meal

B) Nutrition Data
- Calories
- Macros
- Portion sizes

C) Meal Categories
- Breakfast / Lunch / Dinner / Snacks
- Goal-based tagging (fat loss, muscle gain)

Explain how changes made by Superadmin reflect for members.

--------------------------------------------------
7. BACKEND – MEAL PLANNER LOGIC
--------------------------------------------------

Explain backend responsibilities:

- Meal plan generation logic
- How meals are selected based on:
  - Member goal
  - Preferences
  - Diet type
- How meal replacements work
- How tracking (eaten / skipped) is saved
- How reports are calculated

Explain clearly:
- No hardcoded data
- Everything driven from database

--------------------------------------------------
8. DATABASE DESIGN (IMPORTANT)
--------------------------------------------------

Explain all important tables clearly.

Examples (use logical naming, not guessing):
- meals
- meal_food_items

- member_meal_profiles
- member_daily_meals
- meal_tracking
- meal_reports

For each table explain:
- Purpose
- Key columns
- Relations

--------------------------------------------------
9. REPORTING & ANALYTICS
--------------------------------------------------

Explain:
- How daily meal reports are generated
- How calorie totals are calculated
- How consistency score is calculated
- How reports are shown on dashboard

--------------------------------------------------
10. SECURITY & MULTI-TENANCY
--------------------------------------------------

Explain:
- How member data is isolated
- How gymId + memberId scoping works
- Why members cannot see other members’ meal data
- Why Superadmin can see everything

--------------------------------------------------
11. EDGE CASES & RULES
--------------------------------------------------

Explain system behavior for:
- Member skips meals
- Member doesn’t open meal planner
- Meal is deleted by Superadmin
- Nutrition data updated later (history should remain correct)

--------------------------------------------------
12. SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------

End with a clear summary:
- What Meal Planner is
- Who controls it
- How it scales
- Why it fits perfectly into GymSaathi ERP

--------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT RULES
--------------------------------------------------

- Do NOT generate code
- Do NOT invent AI features unless logically required
- Write as PRODUCTION DOCUMENTATION
- Be structured, clear, and detailed
- Assume this explanation will be used by developers and stakeholders

Now produce the full detailed explanation.
