You are a senior full-stack software engineer building a market-ready fitness application called GymSaathi.

Your responsibility is to design and implement the complete Workout Planner module and integrate it into the existing GymSaathi system.

⚠️ DO NOT

Create a new dashboard

Create a new header, footer, or sidebar

Break or redesign the existing UI

Use mock local databases or hardcoded JSON files

All work must be done inside the existing GymSaathi layout and routing system.

🧱 TECH STACK (STRICT – NO DEVIATION)

Frontend: TypeScript (existing framework)

Backend: Node.js + TypeScript

Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)

Storage: Supabase Storage (Workout videos)

Authentication: Existing GymSaathi auth (Supabase-compatible)

No JavaScript-only files.
No Firebase.
No local DBs.

📊 DATASET CLARIFICATION (IMPORTANT)

I am already preparing the final, real dataset for the Workout Planner.

For development and testing purposes, create a COMPLETE DUMMY DATASET inside Supabase.

This dummy dataset must:

Follow the exact same schema intended for production

Be replaceable later without changing any frontend or backend logic

Include realistic workout plans, exercises, and logs

⚠️ Do NOT assume the dummy data is final.

1️⃣ MODULE ACCESS & NAVIGATION

Mobile View: Dashboard → Workout Planner

Desktop View: Sidebar → Workout Planner

Use existing navigation only.

2️⃣ USER ROLES & PERMISSIONS
Member

View assigned or auto-generated workout plans

Track workouts day-wise

Watch exercise videos

Mark sets and exercises as completed or skipped

Trainer

Create and assign workout plans

Edit exercises, sets, reps, rest time

Monitor member adherence

Admin / Super Admin

Manage master exercise library

Manage workout templates

View analytics

3️⃣ MEMBER PROFILE VALIDATION (HARD BLOCK)

Before showing workouts, validate profile data from Supabase.

Mandatory fields:

Age, Gender

Height, Weight, BMI

Fitness Goal

Experience Level

Workout Preference

Workout Days per Week

Session Duration

If missing:
➡ Redirect to Profile Completion
➡ Block Workout Planner

4️⃣ WORKOUT PLAN GENERATION LOGIC

Use BMI + goal + experience to generate workout plans.

Workout splits:

3 days → Full Body

4 days → Upper / Lower

5 days → Push / Pull / Legs

6 days → Body Part Split

5️⃣ EXERCISE STRUCTURE (DUMMY DATA REQUIRED)

For dummy data, create:

20–30 exercises minimum

Multiple muscle groups

Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced levels

Home + Gym equipment variations

Each exercise must include:

Name

Muscle group

Sets

Reps / duration

Rest time

Difficulty

Equipment

Supabase video URL

6️⃣ DUMMY EXERCISE VIDEOS (REQUIRED)

Upload sample exercise videos to Supabase Storage
(can be short demo clips or placeholders)

Generate signed URLs

Map each exercise to a video

Ensure video streaming works in mobile and desktop

⚠️ Video integration must be production-safe.

7️⃣ MEMBER UI FLOW

Weekly workout overview (calendar style)

Day-wise workout details

Workout in-progress screen with:

Set tracking

Rest timer

Workout completion summary

8️⃣ WORKOUT TRACKING & LOGGING (SUPABASE)

Store dummy workout logs:

Completed sets

Actual reps

Time spent

Skipped exercises

Completion status

Logs must simulate real usage.

9️⃣ TRAINER & ADMIN CONTROLS

Trainers can assign dummy workout plans

Admin can manage dummy exercise library

All features must work with dummy data exactly as they will with real data

🔐 DATABASE DESIGN (SUPABASE – STRICT)

Create tables:

users

profiles

workout_plans

workout_days

exercises

exercise_videos

workout_logs

trainer_assignments

Dummy Data Rules

Use realistic values

Maintain foreign key integrity

Do not hardcode IDs

Do not bypass RLS policies

⚙️ QUALITY & REPLACEMENT GUARANTEE

Dummy data must be drop-in replaceable

No UI changes required when real data is inserted

No API changes required later

No schema changes later

✅ FINAL EXPECTATION

Deliver a fully working Workout Planner using:

✔ Supabase
✔ TypeScript
✔ Node.js
✔ Dummy dataset (temporary)
✔ Exercise videos integrated

The system must be ready to accept the real dataset immediately once provided.
