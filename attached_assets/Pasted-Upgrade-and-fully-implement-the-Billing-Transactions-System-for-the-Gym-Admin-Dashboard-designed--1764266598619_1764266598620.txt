Upgrade and fully implement the Billing + Transactions System for the Gym Admin Dashboard, designed specifically for Indian gyms.

Each gym will have its own billing history, invoices, payments, dues, and revenue analytics.

🇮🇳 India-Specific Requirements

💰 Currency = INR only

Use the rupee symbol ₹ everywhere.

NEVER show $, USD, or any other currency.

Format amounts like:

₹499

₹1,200

₹75 / user

📱 Payment methods commonly used in India:

Cash

UPI (Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, etc.)

Card

Optional Razorpay

🔁 Partial payments and dues:

When a visitor converts into a member, they may pay:

Full amount

Partial amount now, remaining amount later

Billing system must track:

Paid amount

Due amount

Payment history

Outstanding balance

🧾 All transactions must be logged

Every single financial activity for a gym must be recorded.

Includes:

Membership payments

Shop purchases

Invoices

Dues/arrears

Partial payments

Refunds

Adjustments

🧱 System Design Requirements
✔ Multi-tenant structure

Every payment belongs to a specific gym, based on gymId.

Each gym sees only its own payments.

✔ CRUD for Payments & Invoices

Admin must be able to:

Add payment (record payment)

Add partial payment

Mark dues paid

Update payment method

Edit or delete a payment

Generate invoices

Link payment ↔ invoice

Track overdue invoices

Track partial-paid invoices

✔ Payment History Table (Gym-Level)

The Payment History section must display:

Member Name

Amount Paid (₹)

Pending Due (₹)

Method (UPI/Cash/Card/Razorpay)

Status (Paid / Pending / Partially Paid / Failed)

Date

Reference ID

Notes

Action Buttons (View / Edit / Delete)

🔄 Workflow: Visitor → Lead → Customer → Payment

Visitor enters → Admin adds Lead

Lead converts to Member

While converting, Admin enters:

Amount paid now

Amount due (if any)

Billing system must:

Update dashboard KPIs immediately

Allow Admin to take remaining payments anytime
